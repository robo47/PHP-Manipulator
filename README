About PHP\Manipulator
---------------------

A command-line tool for manipulating php code.

PHP\Manipulator is build to be easily extendable with your own Actions and Actionsets
[for example for configure multiple Actions forming a Coding-Standard or a
special task for you project] and configurable via a simple xml-file allowing to
choose which files should be changed and which action(set)s should be used on those files.

Code ist hosted at http://www.github.com/robo47/php-manipulator and directly
installable via my PEAR-server pear.robo47.net.

extensions:

* spl
* tokenizer

* dom

libraries:

 * Classloader
 * Console
 * Finder
* PHPUnit 3.4+ (unittests only)

helper script
-------------

The helper.php is only meant for development, it allows an easy and fast creation of new empty dummys for Actions,
TokenConstraints, TokenManipulators, ContainerConstraints and TokenFinders including a unittest-file-dummy and empty fixture-files via
the command line.


Contributing
------------

My aim is to make Contributing to PHP\Manipulator as easy
as possible, therefor using github for issues and code.

If you have some nice additions, fork on github, and send me a pull-request with
a short description of your changes and I will have a look at it and try to
respond to each one if i will include it or not, why not or what i would expect
to change for inclusion.

Contact
-------

Best way to contact me in realtime is probably using Jabber (no i don't use icq/msn/aol/whatever).

JID: robo47@blub-blub.net (THIS IS NO EMAILADRESS!)
EMAIL: robo47@robo47.net

(My timezone is CET/CEST [GMT +1/+2 hours])

The fact that my jabber-account is online and status tells online does not mean
I am really at the PC! So don't get angry if I don't answer immediatly.

You can use GPG for emails and OTR for Jabber
